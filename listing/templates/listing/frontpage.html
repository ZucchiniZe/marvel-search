  <h2>Welcome to nightcrawler!</h2>
  <p>
    Nightcrawler is a indexing and searching site for marvel unlimited.
    This was made out of frustration of the listing and searching of the marvel site.
    It is a very simple webscraper backed by a postgresql database for a cache.
    The name nightcrawler was inspired by the comic book character nightcrawler since this website scrapes marvel.com.
